# :wave: Hi, welcome to Stomble!

This is a temporary documentation written in haste, would be updated and maintained by `Henry Wan`

## :robot: 1. Setting up the repo

**:warning: The current state of the frontend is kinda messy, but we do have plans to change it in the next week or two**

As per usual, clone and install deps
```sh 
# You might be asking why do we have a folder wrapped insode all code
# Idk, its here ever since i joined Stomble

$ git clone https://github.com/StombleOfficial/StombleFrontend.git
$ cd StombleFrontend/frontend-mobile-new_design 
$ yarn # if you're having issues add '--legacy-peer-deps'
```

### Setting up Android emulator and iOS Simulator
* :point_right: Follow [this guide](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/) for Android emulators 
* :point_right: And [this guide](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/) for iOS simulators

### Note: 
```
Henry is dirt poor and could only afford Apple juice as his only 
Apple product. If you're like me you need a vm to run iOS simulators.

It's a canon event ಥ‿ಥ
```

## :runner: 2. Running your code

FYI: We are using React Native and Expo (full stack comes later i have no time as of writing this lol)

```sh
# Assuming you're in ./StombleFrontend/frontend-mobile-new_design
# Damn, thats a mouthful

$ npx expo start
# or 
$ npx expo start --tunnel # depending on your router configuration
```

## :eyes: 3. The code is messy, where should I start
Don't, we're refactoring them soon

----

**WILL BE UPDATED SOON AFTER THE END OF MY TERM IN UNI :muscle:**
